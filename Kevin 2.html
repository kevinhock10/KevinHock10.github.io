<P> I played juniors for the South Shore Kings in the USPHL. I only played there for one year where most kids do play for 2 to 3 years. The year for me was very up and down considering that I was hurt for two parts of the seasons. First I hurt my shoulder, which was not to serious and then at the end of the year I had to have hand surgery on my right hand. It ended my season, which I was not very happy about. The season over all was very good.<p>

<p> I was lucky enough to play in the USPHL Allstar game before my injury to my hand. It was the time of my life because it was a great time to play with the best of the best and to see where you match up. The interviews and everything before the game was the best part because you just feel like a superstar. </p>
