<p> In my family I have an older brother that has atended college already. I have a mother and a father that love each other very much. I have a dog that is 15 years old that my family loves very much. He is my first dog that i can remember in my family. I had a "sister" that lived with me for 5 years. What i mean about "sister" is that she lived with because of other family problems. She was like a sister i never had. It was weird having another girl around the house, but at the end of the 5 years it was sad to see her move back to her home town on the west coast.</p>

<p> This is my brother who has been a role model for me since day one. He has took me under his wing and showed me the way through life. He is the nicest kid I know and will do anything for anyone.
