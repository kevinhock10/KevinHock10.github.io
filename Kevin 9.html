<p> Fishing has been a blast for me since I was a little boy. My Dad has taught me something new about fishing every summer even to this date. Ive been working on fishing charters the past two summers. It has been a great to learn to learn from a guy that does it every day for living. The water is my happy place. I find the ocean as a get away from everything and where i can put my mind on something other than life. I love teaching my others cousins about fishing and teaching them how to catch a fish and hold the fist. It is my seconded favorite thing from hockey.

<P> My favorite type of fishing is hooking a blue fin tuna because they take about an 1 hour to real and the screaming of the line going out is the music to my ears!</p>

<p> Here is a link to a big fish being caught!</p>
